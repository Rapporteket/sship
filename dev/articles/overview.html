<li>Two colleagues working on the same project need to exchange files

their workflow within R. They are not able to make a secure transfer of
such files in cleartext</li>
<li>A person need regular updates of secret data from a centralized data
source. At the source automated R processes can be run to transfer files
to that person. There is no methods available to make a secure transfer

</h2>
<p>This is a very brief summary of what <em>sship</em> does. A more
detailed description of the methods, technology behind it and how to
safely use it is found below.</p>
<p>From within an R session a file is protected using strong encryption.
After encryption the original content of the file will only be available
to those holding the same key used during encryption. Hence, the
encrypted file can now be distributed freely keeping its original
content safeguarded. Obviously, the key to allow decryption of this file
cannot be distributed “openly” which is a problem because any legitimate
recipient of the file will need this key to unlock its content. The key
itself is therefore also encrypted but by the use of a different key:
the public part of a key pair that belongs only to the recipient. This
makes sure that the original key can only be unlocked by the recipient’s
private key. At this stage both the encrypted file and the encrypted key
can be shared (openly) and only the recipient will be able to unlock the
original content.</p>
<p><em>sship</em> also provide tools for the recipient to aid
decryption. However, <em>sship</em> is based on widely used and easy
accessible key crypto-technology and the recipient may well apply other
tools for decryption. R is therefore not a dependency forced upon
recipients.</p>

</h3>
<p>In <em>sship</em> a file is encrypted following a hybrid scheme: the
content itself is encrypted applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm" class="external-link">symmetric
key algorithm</a> using a disposable key. This key is in turn encrypted
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" class="external-link">public-key
cryptography</a> with a public key provided by the recipient Here, the
term “hybrid” refers to that both symmetric an asymmetric encryption
systems are used, and the term “disposable” means that the key used in
the symmetric key algorithm will only be applied once and never re-used
for encryption of data. The public key is associated with a
corresponding private key that is kept secret and only accessible by the
person owning it (in contrast to the public key that can be shared
freely). The encrypted file and encrypted key can now safely be shared
openly. After receiving the encrypted files the recipient follow the
reverse hybrid scheme: the encrypted “symmetric key” is decrypted
applying the recipients private key and then the decrypted symmetric key
is used to decrypt the file holding the original content.</p>
<p>Method of encryption consists of generating a randomized 256 bit key
every time data is to be encrypted. This key is then used to encrypt
data following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" class="external-link">Advance
Encryption Standard</a>. The recipients public key (that was generated
using an RSA crypto system) is collected from his/hers user account at
GitHub and used to asymmetrically encrypt the “symmetric key”. The
encrypted data and encrypted key is then shipped to the recipient. For
practical implementation of encryption and decryption as describe above
the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/" class="external-link">OpenSSL cryptography library</a>
is applied.</p>
<p>This scheme ensures that data privacy are protected by <a href="https://www.keylength.com/" class="external-link">sufficiently strong encryption</a>
also along the lines of the <a href="https://www.nsm.stat.no/globalassets/dokumenter/veiledninger/systemteknisk-sikkerhet/nsm-cryptographic-recommendations-juli19.pdf" class="external-link">recommendations
by the Norwegian National Security Authority</a> and that decryption
only can be performed by the recipient.</p>

<p>Technical measures alone do not guarantee a safe exchange of secrets.
The crucial part of applying <em>sship</em> is the exchange of the
public key from the recipient to the person or entity that do the
encryption (the provider). It is paramount that the recipient is
authenticated to the provider. In other words, the provider must be
absolutely sure that the public key used belongs to the recipient, and
no one else. <strong>If this is not the case <em>sship</em> cannot and
should not be used for any exchange of secrets!</strong> <em>sship</em>
collects the public key from an external and open repository based on a
user id uniquely defining the recipient (and his or hers public key) at
this repository. Such repositories must provide means of authentication
(of the recipient) that allows only the recipient to add or alter user
profile content such as for instance public keys. In general
authentication based on a username and password is not sufficient:
multi-factor authentication of users should be enforced at the
repository providing public keys to <em>sship</em>. In addition, both
the provider and recipient should be part of the same organizational
structure at the repository to make sure that they are both under the
same “governance” with respect to user management. Currently,
<em>sship</em> only supports <a href="https://github.com" class="external-link">GitHub</a> as
a repository for public keys. It allows for both multi-factor
authentication and relevant user management.</p>
