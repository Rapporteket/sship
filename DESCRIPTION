Description: This package provides R users convenient tools for exchanging
    files securely. By file content encryption safe passage (shipment) can be
    provided even through insecure routes such as ftp and email. Based on
    asymmetric cryptography no local management of secrets is needed to
    make a secure shipment as long as authentic public keys are available.
