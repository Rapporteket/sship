Description: Provide peers convenient tools for exchanging files securely from
    within R. By file content encryption safe passage (shipment) can be
    provided even through insecure routes such as ftp and email. Based on
    asymmetric cryptography no management of shared secrets is needed to
    make a secure shipment as long as authentic public keys are available.
    Public keys used for secure shipments may be obtained from external
    providers (currently, github is the only option implemented). Transportation
    of files will require that relevant services such as ftp and smtp servers
    are available.
